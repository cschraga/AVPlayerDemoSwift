# AVPlayerDemoSwift

A Swift version of the AVPlayerDemo on the Apple Web Site

## Usage

The 'VideoViewController.swift' file is intended to be used as a child view controller.  The video methods are pretty self explanatory.  It utilizes the 'AVPlayer' library which you should familiarize yourself with at [Apple Dev](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/AVPlayerDemo/Introduction/Intro.html).
I altered it slightly so that a swipe left and swipe right will skip 30 seconds.  You can touch to scrub by utilizing the scrubber.  I found the touch-to-scrub method tends to cause performance issues.
